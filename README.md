### Installation

### Testing

### API Doc Generation
To automatically generate documentation, run the command "sphinx-apidoc -o ./docs/source/ tincan/" from the TinCanPython directory. Then from the TinCanPython/docs folder run "make html". The docs can then be found in the file "index.html" found in TinCanPython/docs/build/html. 

If you would like to change the names of each section, you can do so by modifying the tincan.rst file found in TinCanPython/docs/source.
